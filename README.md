# automatedCoverLetters
 A small python script which makes use of the Python dictionary to replace words in your cover letter to make it faster to create more. Make sure to edit the master_cover_letter.docx to your liking

Just run the program and enter the name of the company and positon name and you'll get your Cover Letter filled. (this requires a nearly complete cover letter as it just replaces those filler words)
